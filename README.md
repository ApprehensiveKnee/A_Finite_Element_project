# A_Finite_Element_project
### MAIN GOAL:
#### to implement a self-enclosed, naive software (with parallel correspodence) to solve basic 2D elliptic problems, using spectral FE element method (rectangular elements, and Lagrangian polynomial basis) given a mesh generated on a rectangular domain using a matlab script.

### POSSIBLE NEXT DEVELOPEMENTS (provided the time)
#### - implement the elements necessary to solve 1D dynamic problmes using the Nodal Discontinuous Galerkin Methods, given a mesh generated using a matlab script
#### - generalize the spectral method for triangular general meshes
